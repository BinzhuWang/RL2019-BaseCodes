# Coursework 1 - Monte Carlo Methods

You are required to implement the Monte algorithm using the codes provided in `MonteCarloBase.py`. Before going to the task, you should install the HFO Domain first since the task depends on it. Your task is to extend `MonteCarloBase.py` by implementing the unimplemented methods and make a working implementation for Monte Carlo methods.

## Task
You are required to make an implementation of the following methods :
- `learn()`
- `updateQValues(sequenceOfExperience, discountRate)`  
- `toString(self, stateRepresentation)`
- `reset()`
- `act()`
