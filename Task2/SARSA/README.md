# Coursework 1 - SARSA Methods

You are required to implement the Q-Learning algorithm using the codes provided in `SARSABase.py`. Before going to the task, you should install the HFO Domain first since the task depends on it. Your task is to extend `SARSABase.py` by implementing the unimplemented methods.

## Task
You are required to make an implementation of the following methods :
 - `learn()`
 - `act()`
 - `calculateUpdates(stateRepresentationString, action, reward, status, nextStateRepresentation, nextAction)`
 - `toString(stateRepresentation)`
